# Code_Sandbox
A sandbox of code (mostly scripts) with which I tinker.
## Script Directory
1. log-off.bat - Windows batch file to log-off of the current user. 
2. resume_builder.py - I grew tired of finding the exact location within my resume template to modify the position and company to which I was applying. Thus, I've created a script to accelerate the process. The next step is to make the key logic more modular.
3. shutdown.bat - Windows batch file to force shutdown the machine immediately.
