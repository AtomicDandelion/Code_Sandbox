# Code_Sandbox
A sandbox of code (mostly scripts) with which I tinker.
## Script Directory
1. log-off.bat - Windows batch file to log-off of the current user. 
2. minimum_remainder_investment.c - C file to calculate the number of shares from Company A and number from Company B to purchase in order to have the minimum amount leftover (remainder).  
	To run on Windows, install the .zip file from the Releases section [here]{https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit/releases}
3. resume_builder.py - I grew tired of finding the exact location within my resume template to modify the position and company to which I was applying. Thus, I've created a script to accelerate the process. The next step is to make the key logic more modular.
4. shutdown.bat - Windows batch file to force shutdown the machine immediately.
